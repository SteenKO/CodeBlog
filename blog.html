            <h2>Here is <a href="index.html" > Assignment 1</a>.</h2>
            <p>There weren't too many issues that I experienced during this assignment, other than momentarily forgetting how to use the img tag, but I just went back to watch the lecture recording, and that took care of that. The main thing I learned from this assignment was just how to create a simple webpage by applying what I had learned from the lectures about GitHub and HTML. The main resources I used were the lecture recordings and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_rounded_images.asp" > this tutorial</a> to make my image look a little bit nicer. This assignment was a good way to familiarize myself with the sort of work I will be doing in this class, and I feel a bit more confident in my abilities going forward.</p>

            <h1>Assignment 2, 10/24/2022</h1>
            <p>This was overall a very challenging assignment for me. I struggled a lot with flexboxes and aligning the text and text boxes in the filter container. I spent a lot of time rewatching the lectures and looking on Google. I learned a lot about CSS in general with this assignment, like flexboxes, buttons, and animations. The resources that helped me the most with this assignment were the lecture recordings and tutorials like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_pill_button.asp" > this</a> which helped explain specific CSS procedures to me. I had to Google a guide on flexboxes, how to transform buttons when hovering over them, and I had to get a refresher on the difference between padding and margins.</p>

            <h1>Assignment 3, 11/7/2022 </h1>
            <p> On this assignment, I struggled a lot with the filtering and creating of the posts. I learned a good amount about Javascript, but I feel like there are still a ton of concepts I can learn with Javascript. It feels like a familiar language, but the application of it to a web page is not something I am used to, so I struggled a bit with that. I spent a lot of time rewatching the lectures, and I also looked at W3 schools for their javascript tutorials. I used <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-select-a-radio-button-by-default-in-javascript" > this tutorial </a> to help with the modal clearing.  </p>

            <h1> Assignment 4, 11/14/2022 </h1>
            <p> I struggled with the implementation of server side js on this assignment, and especially with using the req and res arguments. I learned the basics of setting up a server, and how to use a rudimentary file system. I also did some learning about error codes. It was cool to get some background on those, instead of just seeing them on google chrome when my browser is having issues and not knowing what they meant. THe lecture recordings were helpful, and W3 schools helped a lot with syntax and other ways of connecting to my server. I ended up googling and going through the node.js tutorial on W3 schools for help on this assignment.
