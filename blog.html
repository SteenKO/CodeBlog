            <h2>Here is <a href="index.html" > Assignment 1</a>.</h2>
            <p>There weren't too many issues that I experienced during this assignment, other than momentarily forgetting how to use the img tag, but I just went back to watch the lecture recording, and that took care of that. The main thing I learned from this assignment was just how to create a simple webpage by applying what I had learned from the lectures about GitHub and HTML. The main resources I used were the lecture recordings and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_rounded_images.asp" > this tutorial</a> to make my image look a little bit nicer. This assignment was a good way to familiarize myself with the sort of work I will be doing in this class, and I feel a bit more confident in my abilities going forward.</p>

            <h1>Assignment 2, 10/24/2022</h1>
            <p>This was overall a very challenging assignment for me. I struggled a lot with flexboxes and aligning the text and text boxes in the filter container. I spent a lot of time rewatching the lectures and looking on Google. I learned a lot about CSS in general with this assignment, like flexboxes, buttons, and animations. The resources that helped me the most with this assignment were the lecture recordings and tutorials like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_pill_button.asp" > this</a> which helped explain specific CSS procedures to me. I had to Google a guide on flexboxes, how to transform buttons when hovering over them, and I had to get a refresher on the difference between padding and margins.</p>

            <h1>Assignment 3, 11/7/2022 </h1>
            <p> On this assignment, I struggled a lot with the filtering and creating of the posts. I learned a good amount about Javascript, but I feel like there are still a ton of concepts I can learn with Javascript. It feels like a familiar language, but the application of it to a web page is not something I am used to, so I struggled a bit with that. I spent a lot of time rewatching the lectures, and I also looked at W3 schools for their javascript tutorials. I used <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-select-a-radio-button-by-default-in-javascript" > this tutorial </a> to help with the modal clearing.  </p>
